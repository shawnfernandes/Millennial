STREE

Genre: Horror comedy

From the director that gave us small-town fairytale movies like 'Ranjhaana' to the more recent 'Manmarziyan', Anand L. Rai delivers a production far removed from his repertoire, a horror comedy. Loosely drawn from the urban myth of a wicked spirit named 'Nale Ba' that became a household nuisance of humungous proportions in the 90's in Karnataka, Stree is set in the remote town of Chanderi, where women's ethnic sartorial choices are as popular as the titular monstress herself. 'Stree" has a strikingly remarkable foible i.e to abduct married men at night, but only during four specific religious days in the year. To keep the evil spirit away from their abodes, the villagers shoo her away with a writing on the walls: "Stree yahan mat aana".(Yes, ghosts actually listen to writings on a wall). 

In the midst of this brouhaha is Vicky (Rajkumar Rao), a tailor by profession, but not just any tailor. His customers, all women, swear by his craft, and so, throng his shop to get their blouses, salwars, and saris all stitched and tailored to perfection. Sitting on the rooftop of his shop one afternoon during his break, Vicky has a mysterious encounter with Shraddha Kapoor, who wishes to get her blouse stitched from the local famed tailor himself. Besotted by her beauty, Vicky instantly agrees, but in his illusion of mesmerism, forgets to ask any details pertaining to Kapoor. This seems strange to his friend, Bittu (Aparshakti Khurana), who wonders whether Vicky's cryptic meet was with none other than "Stree" herself, albeit disguised in human form. Meanwhile, with the festival commencing in a few days, Rudra( Pankaj Tripathi), an ayurvedic baba, warns the villagers of the apparent threat they face, and offers solutions on how to tackle the wretched demoness. Will the evil one wreck the haunted town of Chanderi, or will the villagers manage to put an end to the ghostly hedonism? 

Save for a few nonsensical scenes, Stree evolves as a delightfully humorous watch, with Rao's rustic and innocent persona and his pals' Bittu and Janna's (Abhishek Banerjee) comity coalescing well to build the mystery and intrigue that surrounds this mystical creature. Kapoor is gorgeous and illuminates the screen by her sheer presence, but her delivery is too stolid and uptight. Although it doesn't hamper the buildup of the plotline, it does become evident in the penultimate scenes of the movie. However, Tripathi manages to veil this well, with his clever comic timing and notorious admonishing. A word of appreciation for director Amar Kaushik, who doesn't rely on over the top caricature. The characters are authentic and simple, which keeps the movie light-hearted and fun and doesn't necessarily over-indulge in cringe-worthy drama.

Stree desires to be a frolicking watch, reveling in the fear it creates in the lives of its central characters, while subtly trivializing the foibles of the evil monstress. And it does that just aptly, making it a leave-your-brains-behind piece that you definitely wouldn't want to miss!!
