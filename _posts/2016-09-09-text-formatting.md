First man - Neil Armstrong ! 

In 1968, Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey not only commenced the era of space films - it introduced such majestic and unprecedented visual and auditory elements in tandem that it propelled Kubrick into cinematic immortality. Director Damien Chazelle draws a few colours from Kubrick's aesthetic and thematic palette in his latest space venture, but also manages to inject his own inimitable style.  A despondent, almost grim tone is set from the very go that invokes a subtle sense of empathy and compassion for the titular hero - similar to the setting of the  "The Shining" ( directed by Kubrick), which, just by its mysterious and isolated backdrops and haunting alleyways, evoked an eerie feeling of timidity and ghastliness. 

One of the aspects vital to a Kubrickian picturization is a sublime and ethereal background score, transcendental in its harmony and mystical in its rhythm - that captures the explorative spirit of the human endeavor, and with it, the undying thirst of man's desire for experiencing the unknown - much like Hans Zimmer's breathtaking composition for Interstellar. Back then, Kubrick had the Strauss brothers to thank, and in First Man, Damien Chazelle has Justin Hurwitz. In a set-piece consisting of about six main classical style melodies, Hurwitz encapsulates the tense and mellow mood to an unnatural degree of perfection - the kind that actually serves as an effective concealment to the raw and intended, but majorly jarring cinematography. 

Set against the political backdrop of the Space Race between the US and erstwhile USSR, NASA is determined to come out on top and sets in motion an intensive program to venture out into a place no man has ever hazarded before- the moon. The opening sequence is an intensely visceral and proximate depiction of Neil's sojourn to the earth's atmosphere on an X-15 rocket plane that proves to be unsuccessful. Almost immediately, the narrative shifts from this high-octane action scene to a quiet, glum household of the Armstrongs where Karen, Neil's (Ryan Gosling) and Janet's (Claire Foy) daughter is diagnosed with a rare form of brain tumour. Karen succumbs to the disease, and Neil immerses himself in his work even more deeply, applying for Project Gemini, which was the premature spaceflight program ordained to support the ultimate Apollo mission- the mission to the moon. The family moves to Houston, along with the other astronaut families, and Janet befriends Pat White (Olivia Hamilton), who is the wife of fellow civilian pilot Ed White (Jason Clarke). 

Meanwhile, Janet and Neil have a second son, Mark and things finally begin to look upwards for them, with the family bonding with the White's. Ed is informed by his superior that he would be commanding the Apollo mission, along with two other pilots. On a plugs-out test performed before the actual launch, the cockpit catches fire and the conflagration claims lives of all three pilots, killing Ed. A year later, Neil along with two other pilots, Buzz Aldrin (Corey Stoll) and Micheal Collins (Lukas Hass) are sanctioned to officially helm the Apollo mission. On the night before Neil's departure, Janet instructs him to convey to their two sons the possibility of him not returning back from the mission. Neil is dumbfounded in a way that he's unable to bring himself to admit it, but does it eventually. Apollo 11 finally launches with Neil, Buzz and Collins and reach the moon' surface on the fourth day of their mission, marking an extraordinary accomplishment. In the penultimate scene, the three pilots are placed in quarantine, amidst an uncontrollable media frenzy surrounding their achievement.

A striking feature of the film's narrative is Chazelle's emphasis on potraying Armstrong's sensitivities to the situations shaping up around him, and how these series of mishaps inadvertently serve to delicately reinforce his steely resolve. Be it the loss of his daughter and the subsequent disconsolate mood of his loved ones that he sought to improve, or the unexpected death of Ed White that  hollowed him out emotionally, Armstrong battles it rather introvertishly in his own way, never allowing these vicissitudes to overpower his gumption and his sense of equanimity.  This recurring theme forms the bedrock of Chazelles's storytelling delivery and lends us the lens through which he expects the audience to perceive the enigma . Gosling is undeniably impressive in exhibiting this understated mood, letting his tranquil and laconic personality do most of the talking, without it being too insipid and dull. His equation with Foy gives the film a heavy dose of realism and naturalness, with Foy's levelheaded and pragmatic potrayal also serving as an antidote to Gosling's eventual disillusionment, in the later parts of the film.

Though Chazelle manages to present Armstrong eclectically, a great deal of sentimental emphasis is given to the spaceship docking scene, which unfortunately, doesn't manage to strike a poignant chord. The visuals of the descent of the Apollo 11, along with Hurwitz's surreal score is a spine-tingling, majestic, visual masterpiece and elevates the film to astounding heights. But in all its grandeur and transcendency, the sheer essence of the historic achievement is lost. For Armstrong, his appetite for scientific inquiry, that helped him embattle against all odds back on earth,suddenly gives way to an emotional outpouring of sorts, as soon as he lands on the surface of the moon - which is a poetic and romantic nuance, but on many levels, is implausible. 

Chazelle succeeds in getting most of the elements in his film right and executes it brilliantly, making it an exhiliarating and thrilling watch, amalgamating the drama and the sci-fi facets aptly while allowing the viewer to immerse in a truly engaging expedition of the unparalleled. But it's Hurwitz's 34-track musical composition that flies away with the screenplay and takes it into a higher artistic dimension. The score should definitely earn its creator an Oscar nomination, if not the award itself. Chazelle too should be lionized for his picturesque spectacle and its certainly one that would make the torchbearer of the sci-fi genre, Mr. Kubrick, extremely proud!
