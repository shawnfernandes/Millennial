“Love in the face of adversity”- a theme explored innumerable times by numerous directors in varied
contexts has always resonated with cinephiles not just in our country, but also around the world.
Keeping the crux of this love story in tune with the aforementioned theme, Director Shashank
Khaitan’s Dhadak is an adaptation of the Marathi musical romantic drama, Sairat, which not so long
ago wowed audiences with its stark and gut-wrenching portrayal of two young lovebirds eloping
ergo of an oppressive and rigid socio-political habitat and subsequently, learning the art of
cohabitation and survival in penurious hardships, day by day. It’s hard not to draw comparisons
between the two, as the set of events occurring in both are only slightly disparate. But for the sake
of treating a piece of art just by itself and not in conjunction with another so that the essence isn’t
lost, this review would not be drawing anything from the Marathi drama.

Madhukar (Ishan Khatter) is your typical run-of-the-mill college going chichora, who manages his
father’s restaurant by day and lives a life of carefree abandon along with his two pals. Upon a chance
glance at Parthavi (Jhanvi Kapoor), who happens to be the daughter of a top ranking and upper caste
soon-to-be-contesting politician (Ashutosh Rana), he instantly becomes besotted and consequently
spends the best part of his days wooing her, much to the dismay of his restauranteur father.
Eventually, cupid strikes, and along with the arrows of love that unite them, are the swords of
dissent and oppression arising from the families who are vehemently opposed to their union.
Circumstances ensue that force the protagonists to flee their once-heavenly abode.

Their struggle for survival brings them to Kolkata, where they aim to start life afresh and seek to
make ends meet. Although arduous and painstaking at first, Madhukar and Parthavi battle the
everyday challenges and gradually, things begin to look upwards for them. He finds himself
employed as a waiter, she at a reputed call centre. As time passes, they welcome a new-born, which
induces a new freshness in their social dynamic, and they begin to conceive a foreseeable future.

The first forty-five minutes of the film are dedicated exclusively to the progression of the love story,
a tad too much for a film that aims to emphasize on the social dogmas of caste hierarchy and honor
killings that plague our rural societies. Needless scenes of over-indulgence in courtship are in
abundant supply, to the point that it’s cringeworthy even by Bollywood standards. Where there is
room for cutting down the melodrama and over-zealousness, Khaitan has unabashedly chosen to
give these more importance, making it an overbearing watch.

Kapoor’s character has substance, meat, punch, call it whatever you want! It cries for a presentment
of obsession, of determination, of dare-devilishness, of angst and a flurry of other emotions that
gifts a golden opportunity to its owner to display the full range of acting that most actors (female) in
the Hindi Industry wish and yearn for. In some of the most crucial scenes of the movie, Parthavi as a
character requires to exude a greater degree of gusto and determination. Unfortunately, Kapoor
doesn’t grasp the occasion, and is by no means convincing as Parthavi. Her inability to emote any
emotion profoundly sticks out like a sore thumb, especially in the scenes with Khattar, who contrasts
her with his raw magnetism, appeal and intensity that serves him well as the “local Romeo”.

Though the film was far off the bull’s eye on almost all fronts, the only half decent aspect is the
background score. Be it giving a freshness and enthusiasm that is associated with infatuation for
your love interest or capturing the zeitgeist of a celebrative environment or even portraying the
angst between the leads in the later stages of the story, the music supports the narrative ably. And
easily the best example of this is the penultimate scene, with the score used brilliantly to build
tension and intrigue that precipitates into a truly shocking and jaw-dropping climax that will have
your heart pounding and your mind aghast. The script, along with the editing, is plain shoddy,
especially in the second half. The political angle and premise seems intermittent in its frequency and
convenience, appearing only when the narrative needs to be driven ahead.

Director Shashank Khaitan seems to be caught up between having to capture the soul of “Sairat” and
infusing his own elements of interest. It’s unclear what he set out to do: Drown the viewer in the
soul-stirring and agonizing journey of two lovers or highlight the abject apathy of rural society in
matters of religious pride through the context of the love story. One thing is a sure takeaway: The
film doesn’t manage to do either. Neither does it make for an engaging watch nor does it leave you
with any significant lasting memory.
