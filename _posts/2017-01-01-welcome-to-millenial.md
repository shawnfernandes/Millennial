                                       GULLY BOY - "APNA TIME AAYEGA!!"
                                                    
Straight from the outset, Gully Boy ventures directly into the hard-hitting and uncompromising milieu of the slums of Dharavi, where poverty is a norm and candidness isn't a remarkable virtue amongst it's defiant and dogmatic inhabitants. Emerging within this climate is a new musical cult called "Gully rap", a genre that finds favour as a novel medium of expression for the strife-laden youth in the ghetto, akin to the underground and foul-mouthed rap style in Eminem-starrer '8 Mile'. 

Ranveer Singh is a doomed chaeffeur, following his father's (Vijay Raaz) footsteps, trying desperately to break free from the shackles of his supposed fate. Upon witnessing a rap battle which immediately ignites his fancy, Singh starts to prep himself and soon finds recognition. He is egged on his journey by his possessive, thuggish and almost boisterous girlfriend Safeena (Alia Bhatt), who isn't hesitant to be vitriolic against anyone who comes in between them or his career. Singh is right at home with his rugged disposition, playing the protagonist with great ease and earnestness while Bhatt seems to be essaying an outlandish 'Bombaiya' version of Kumari, her character in Udta Punjab, also with great finesse. Kalki Koechlin plays the role of Sky, a free-spirited woman, and it would be interesting to see how she influences the plotline and the characters in general. 

Poverty, when amalgamated with adversity and conflict, has always proven to be a great recipe for storytelling. With a musical backdrop at the core of its plot, Gully Boy promises to be a thrilling entertainer, a "Rap-to-Riches" story that could prove to be fitting tributes to its two inspirations, Divine and Naezy. The songs and its tonality have already struck a chord with the masses, and the screenplay, helmed by Jay Oza, captures the gritty underbelly of the ghetto aptly. Here's hoping the movie turns out to be as promising as the trailer.

Gully Boy has been produced by Excel Entertainment and Tiger Baby and releases on 14th February, 2019.
