    <p>SANJU – One man, many lives!

Rajkumar Hirani, through his cult films like the Munnabhai Series and 3 Idiots, has shown his
outstanding ability to succinctly capture the emotional trajectories of its leading characters. In Sanju,
Hirani enhances his burgeoning reputation as a master storyteller. However, in all fairness, the story
is very subtly biased towards his protagonist, omitting incidents and events from real life that had an
equivalent if not greater impact on his outlook and personality as a man.

A blinkered perception of Sanju, which would entail minimal to no knowledge of his brazen yet
inspiring life, would grow on the audience’s imagination and be able to illicit empathy for a man, who
by some miracle, is still well and living amongst us. On the contrary, if you’re one of those who are
well versed with his remarkable episodes, a very point-blank analysis would lead you to conclude that
Hirani, in his attempt to dramatize his capricious subject, has created a hagiography and not a biopic.

The opening scene of the movie takes us to the sea-facing high-rise apartment of Dutt (Ranbir Kapoor)
practicing his speech, preceding the release of his autobiography penned by Tripathi (Piyush Mishra),
a small time bogus writer who Dutt has entrusted to capture his life events. Tripathi likens Sanju (Baba)
to Bapu, pointing out subtle similarities between the two. The juxtaposition is uncanny, and Hirani
cleverly uses this to give us an insight into what the movie has set out to do: establish Sanjay Dutt as
a falsified victim of a series of unfortunate events. This scene very blatantly exposes Hirani’s desire to
side with his main character.
Incensed with Tripathi’s nonsensical and incendiary opening to the book, Sanju willfully burns it, while
wife Maanyata (Dia Mirza) looks on. In comes famed writer from London, Winnie Dias (Anushka
Sharma), who takes up the job, amongst much caution from especially one Zubin Mistry (Jim Sarbh),
who happens to be Dutt’s one-time best friend or “God” in his youth. Through the ensuing interaction
between Sanju and Dias, the movie starts off in unraveling the checkered life of Sanjay Dutt.
Right from Dutt’s first movie Rocky, to his inability to deal with nepotism and with it the lofty
expectations of being Sunil Dutt’s( Paresh Rawal) son, to his inevitable descent into the world of
illusions against a backdrop of an ailing mother he loved purely( apart from his love for drugs) and
back to normalcy after two years in rehab, Hirani has given us an honest and no-holds barred portrayal
of the fledgling who seemed incapable of handling the personal trauma and the professional hazards
of his spoon-fed stardom. But this wouldn’t be possible without the brilliance and sheer excellence of
the films leading man, Ranbir Kapoor. With a knack for sinking deep into the skin of the characters,
Kapoor plays Dutt with the artistry of a veteran. It’s very rare to see such a young actor be able to
embody not just the superficial, but also the internal. The physical and emotional transformation that
Kapoor depicts, right from being a diffident young Rocky to the “macho” man he’s come to be known
as, is sure to bring plaudits, praises and awards galore for the man who has long been questioned for
his choices and doubted for his range. And boy, doesn’t he deserve every bit of it!
During his drug-laden phase, Dutt befriends Kamlesh Kapasi (Vicky Kaushal) in a hospital where his
ailing mother Nargis (Manisha Koirala) had been admitted for cancer treatment. The camaraderie
between Kapoor and Kaushal, that unfolds and engenders a bond thereafter, is by far the most
delightful and the apogee of the film. Kaushal, as a scrupulous but soft-hearted Gujarati companion
whom Sanju relies on as his emotional support, is surprisingly marvelous. The scene in which a drunk

Kaushal pleads with Paresh Rawal to take care of his prodigious and directionless son is sure to send
a shiver down your spine and strike a melancholic and poignant chord.
The second half of the film revolves largely on Dutt’s mingling with the underworld and the
subsequent struggle he underwent because of his connections. And through this entire segment,
Rawal shines, delivering a nuanced and understated but equally effective performance as Sunil Dutt.
He manages to draw you into developing the same compassionate feelings as he does for his son.
Standing like a rock through his son’s life of debauchery and utter recklessness, Rawal grows on you
like a simmering volcano and leaves a profound impact. Koirala is decent as Nargis in her cameo, as is
Anushka who is limited in the scope of her character but does justice to it. Dia Mirza as Maanyata
hasn’t been given much to work with, but her depiction of the stoic disposition in the face of adversity
translates well on the screen.
All in all, through Hirani’s trademark tragicomic and bittersweet filmmaking style and with it, Abhijat
Joshi’s clever dialogues, not for a moment do you feel the narrative being stretched or overdone. Ravi
Varman’s cinematography is creditable and does justice in displaying the “variety wala life” of its
protagonist. AR Rahman’s soulful music adds the punch required to aggrandize the highs and lows,
especially “Kar Har Maidan Fateh”.
If there’s any criticism to be levelled against the movie, it stems solely in the script. What could have
been an honest and factually accurate portrayal is shrouded with careful selection and depiction of
episodes that exposes Dutt’s raffish aura, but none that extensively malign his reputation. And ironic
as it may seem, all this comes from a director who once extolled Bapu’s virtues of veracity and truth!</p>
